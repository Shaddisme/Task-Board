## Kanban Board Application

This project implements a simple Kanban board for task management, allowing users to organize tasks into different stages of completion. It provides a user-friendly interface where tasks can be added, edited, and moved between columns. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the Bootstrap framework for styling and jQuery UI for drag-and-drop functionality.

### Features:

- **Task Management**: Users can add new tasks with titles, descriptions, and deadlines.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Tasks can be dragged between columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done) to reflect their current status.
- **Dynamic Styling**: Task cards dynamically change color based on their deadline proximity, with red indicating overdue tasks.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are stored locally in the browser's storage, allowing users to persist their task lists across sessions.

### File Structure:

- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the Kanban board layout.
- **style.css**: Defines the custom styles for the application, including task card styling and lane layout.
- **script.js**: Implements the functionality of the Kanban board, including task management and drag-and-drop interactions.
- **Assets/**: Directory containing additional assets such as fonts and icons.

### Setup:

To run the application, simply open `index.html` in a web browser. No additional setup is required.

### Usage:

1. Add tasks using the "Add Task" button.
2. Drag tasks between columns to update their status.
3. Click on task cards to view or edit task details.
4. Delete tasks using the trash icon on each card.

Enjoy organizing your tasks with the Kanban board!
